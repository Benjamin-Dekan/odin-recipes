    <h2>Description</h3>
    <p>Kürtöskalács, a delectable pastry hailing from Hungary, has captured the attention of dessert enthusiasts worldwide. Also known as chimney cake, this traditional dessert is crafted by wrapping a strip of dough around a cylinder-shaped baking spit, then rolling it in sugar and roasting it over an open fire until it achieves a golden brown hue.</p>
    <p>Boasting a crispy exterior and a soft, fluffy interior, Kürtöskalács is often infused with cinnamon or other aromatic spices, and can be served either plain or filled with a variety of sweet or savory ingredients.</p>

    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>If you are using active dry yeast, add ½ teaspoon sugar to lukewarm milk and set aside for 5-10 minutes until it proofs (becomes foamy).</li>
        <li>In a large bowl combine, flour, sugar and salt. To this add egg, milk, melted butter, and yeast Stir the mixture until it comes together to form a dough, and then knead for about five minutes.</li>
        <li>It will be sticky. Don't be tempted to add any flour. Grease your hand if needed.</li>
        <li>Transfer to a well greased container</li>
        <li>Allow the dough to rise for 60 minutes at room temperature until doubled in volume</li>
        <li>Prepare the rolling pins by covering them with aluminum foil, do at least two or three layers, to protect the pins from burning in the oven.</li>
        <li>Make sure to cover the rolling pins very well. Brush them with melted butter.</li>
        <li>The risen dough after 60 minutes.</li>
        <li>Punch down the dough and divide into 4 equal parts about 4 oz (115 gm) of each.</li>
        <li>On a well floured surface spread one portion of the dough</li>
        <li>Shape into ⅙ inch (4 mm) thick square-shaped sheet.</li>
        <li>Using a pizza cutter cut the dough into a long ribbons of about ½ inch (13 mm) wide.</li>
        <li>Wrap one end of the dough strip around the spit/rolling pin, tucking in the end so the dough doesn't unwind.</li>
        <li>eep the dough very thin (under ¼ inch (6 mm)) as you stretch and wind it on the rolling pun. Then roll the whole thing slightly on the counter top to flatten it/press it together.</li>
        <li>Brush with melted butter, roll in sugar</li>
        <li>Place in roasting pan and bake in a preheated moderately hot oven 375°F/190?C/gas mark 5 for 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>If using roast function (375 F/190 C) in the oven it will take about 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>If you are grilling (broiling) over the fire cooking time is about six minutes, until it starts to take on a dark golden color. Turn the rolling pin at once least once (or more) throughout baking time to ensure uniform cooking.</li>
        <li>When cake is done roll it in sugar again</li>
        <li>Tap the mold on a table top to release the cake and set it up right to cool.</li>
